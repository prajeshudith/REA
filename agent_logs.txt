Do you approve this action?"}`
responded: Objective:
- Break down the existing Epic (ID: 3) into further tasks if necessary and manage them effectively.

Analysis:
- The Epic "Parabank Authentication and Navigation" currently has three tasks:
  1. Handle Login Error Scenarios
  2. Develop Registration Page Navigation
  3. Implement Login Functionality
- These tasks cover the basic requirements of the Epic, but further breakdown might be needed for detailed implementation, testing, and documentation.

Action Plan:
1. **Analyze Existing Tasks:**
   - Review the current tasks to identify any missing components or areas that require further breakdown.
   
2. **Identify Additional Tasks:**
   - Consider tasks for testing, documentation, and any additional features or improvements.
   - Potential new tasks could include:
     - Create Unit Tests for Login Functionality
     - Document User Authentication Process
     - Conduct Security Review for Authentication Module

3. **Groom New Tasks:**
   - Define titles, descriptions, acceptance criteria, and estimates for each new task.
   - Ensure alignment with the Epic's objectives and acceptance criteria.

4. **Push to Boards:**
   - Create new tasks in the project management tool with all necessary details.

5. **Check Team Capacity:**
   - Review the current sprint capacity for the aimetlab Team to ensure these tasks can be accommodated.

6. **Assign Tasks:**
   - Assign tasks to team members based on their capacity and roles.

Metrics / Expected Outcomes:
- Successful creation and assignment of new tasks.
- Improved clarity and manageability of the Epic.
- Efficient utilization of team capacity.

Summary:
I will proceed to create and groom additional tasks for the Epic, then check the team's capacity for assignment. Let's start by creating the new tasks.
